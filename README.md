This is an annotation tool for screenshots. I will insert it into xmonad pipeline for handling Alt-PrtScr keypress (it currently use 
`maim -s $TMPFILE` and `xclip` to paste it into the clipboard. 

I used chatGPT to write the skeleton of this script, along with several other sessions to make it useful and improve it.
